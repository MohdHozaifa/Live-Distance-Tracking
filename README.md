# Live-Distance-Tracking
 The Live Distance Tracker is a web-based application designed to calculate and display the distance traveled by a user in real time. The project leverages the HTML5 Geolocation API to access the user's latitude and longitude coordinates at regular intervals. Using this data, the application calculates the distance moved and displays it dynamically.
